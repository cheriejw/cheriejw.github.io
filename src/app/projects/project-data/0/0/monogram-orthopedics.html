    During this 1 month contract I developed the frontend prototype for a start up company that uses technology (machine learning, 
    robotics, and 3D printing) to improve joint replacement surgeries. I was provided with wireframes, a Python server, and the pleasure
    of working with a medical student with well researched ideas about how I would carry out this task.<br/>
    This was the first time I had done freelance, and it was very exciting, but also a lot of responsibilty because I was a one-(wo)man team.
    I hit a couple of road blocks and spent many hours thinking of how to get around them while keeping in mind all the trade-offs. I mainly
    worked in Javascript.
    
    <h4>Things I learned</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>I embarassingly learned the hard way that <code>scripts</code> are imported in order (order matters) on the html document.</li>
      <li>Frameworks are useful for their scaffolding and also so I don't have to write my own router.</li>
      <li>Read the docs about the technology before you start coding. Sometimes copy and pasting doesn't work...<i>(surprise)</i></li>
      <li>There are many hacky pieces of Javascript to be found to implement my hacky work around because I had lacked much experience.</li>
    </ul>

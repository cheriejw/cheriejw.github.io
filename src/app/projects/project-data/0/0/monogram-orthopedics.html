    During this 1 month contract I developed the frontend prototype for a start up company that uses technology (machine learning, 
    robotics, and 3D printing) to improve joint replacement surgeries. I was provided with wireframes, a Python server, and the pleasure
    of working with a medical student with well researched ideas about how I would carry out this task.

    This was the first time I had done freelance, and it was very exciting, but also a lot of responsibilty because I was a one-(wo)man team.
    I hit a couple of road blocks and spent many hours thinking of how to get around them while keeping in mind all the trade-offs.
